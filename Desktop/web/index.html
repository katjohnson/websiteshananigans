     <h2><center> An aspiring web developer on a mission to change the world!<center> </h2>
     <p><center> After many years of exploring, traveling, and experiencing life - I am going to use my knowledge and passion to build websites which reach millions and change lives. I spent the last eight years in service to our military and am ready to break free and make a difference in this world that doesn't involve war, hate, and the breeding of an indifferent society. <p><center> 
     <p><center> I love life is all of it's glory. I am most interested in networking with people who genuinely want to use their coding abilities to create websites which will genuinely transform lives. <p><center>
